# TODO list for new pipelines

1. Edit `README.md` to document your pipeline's functionality.

2. Edit `openfido.py` to implement your pipeline python3 code.

3. Add modules used to `requirements.txt`.

4. Create autotests in folders names `autotest/input_{1,2,...}`. Always create a `config.csv` and add any supporting data files required for the validation test.

5. Delete this file when you are done.

6. Commit and publish you new pipeline to GitHub.
